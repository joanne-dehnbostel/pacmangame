<li>When you click the "Add PacMan" button, a new pacman should appear at a random position on the screen.</li>
<li>When you click the "Start Game" button, the pacman or pacmen created should start moving at random velocity on the screen.</li>
<li>When a given pacman hits the edge of the screen, it should change position to stay within the frame of the web page.</li>
